# Temperature-and-Humidity-Sensing-using-IoT
We designed a portable device capable of reading humidity and temperature using NodeMCU, DHT11 sensor, Arduino IDE, and ThingSpeak.
The JavaScript program, named "index.html," has been developed to be used with the device. It is designed to store a week's worth of humidity and temperature data. 
The program retrieves data from the cloud and saves it for later viewing.
